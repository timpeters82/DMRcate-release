CHANGES IN DMRcate VERSION 1.0.2

BUG FIXES
•	annotate() renamed to cpg.annotate to avoid clashes with same-named function in ggplot2

NEW FEATURES
•	Kernel estimator has been rewritten from scratch without the need for ks:::kde. Now only takes moderated t-values as cpg weights, as required by the chi-square transformation. 
•	Now allows for multi-level factor experiments, as allowed by limma. Contrasts should be specified with a contrast matrix, otherwise the design matrix MUST have an intercept. (Thanks to Tim Triche Jr. and David Martino for their advice).
•	A GRanges object can be produced from the results.
•	XY probes can also be filtered out using rmSNPandCH().
•	DMR.plot() allows group median lines to be plotted to better visualise distances between groups (Thanks to Susan van Dijk and Magnus Tobiasson for their advice).

CHANGES IN DMRcate VERSION 1.2.1 

- Extra control for Type I error through DMR constituents made commensurate with # of differential limma probes
- CITATIONs added
