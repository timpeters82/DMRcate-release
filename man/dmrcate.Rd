\title{
DMR identification
}
\description{
  The main function of this package. Computes a kernel density estimate
  against a null comparison to identify significantly differentially (or
  variable, or hyper-) methylated regions in hg19.
}
\usage{
dmrcate(object, bw = 1000, p.adjust.method = "BH", pcutoff = 0.05,
    consec=FALSE, consecbw=10, betacutoff=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    A class of type "annot", created from \code{\link{annotate}}. 
  }
  \item{bw}{
    Gaussian kernel bandwidth for density estimation. Also informs DMR
    bookend definition; gaps >= \code{bw} between significant probes
    will be in separate DMRs since they do not lend support to each
    other. Support is truncated at 3.7 s.d. Default is 1000
    nucleotides. See details for further info.
  }
  \item{p.adjust.method}{
    Method for \emph{p}-value adjustment from the significance test. Default is
    \code{"BH"} (Benjamini-Hochberg).
  }
  \item{pcutoff}{
    \emph{p}-value cutoff to determine DMRs.
  }
  \item{consec}{
    Use \code{DMRcate} in consecutive probe mode. Treats CpG sites as equally spaced.
  }
  \item{consecbw}{
    Bandwidth in \emph{probes} (rather than nucleotides) to use when
    \code{consec=TRUE}. When specified the variable \code{bw} simply
    becomes the minumum distance separating DMRs.
  }
  \item{betacutoff}{
    Optional filter; removes any region from the results that does not have at least one         CpG site with a beta fold change exceeding this value.
  }
}
\details{

  The value of \code{bw} should be chosen with care. We recommend a
  bandwidth of 1 kilobase (\code{bw=1000}). If \code{bw} is too small
  then the kernel estimator will not have enough support to
  significantly differentiate the weighted estimate from the null
  distribution. If it is too large then \code{dmrcate} will report very
  long DMRs spanning multiple gene loci.

  Many gene loci have lengths reaching into the hundreds of thousands of
  base pairs, so it is quite possible that multiple signficant regions
  will have identical values in \code{results$gene_assoc}. This is fine;
  these regions are distinct in that they are at the very least
  \code{bw} nucleotides apart, and is preferable to attempting collapse
  into a super-DMR by increasing \code{bw}.

\value{
  A list containing 2 data frames (\code{input} and \code{results}) and a numeric value (\code{cutoff}). \code{input} contains the contents of the \code{annot} object, plus calculated \emph{p}-values:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{ID}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{weights}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{CHR}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{pos}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{gene}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{group}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{betafc}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{raw}: Raw \emph{p}-values from the significance test
    \item \code{fdr}: Adjusted \emph{p}-values from the significance test
  }
  \code{results} contains an annotated data.frame of significant
  regions, ranked by \code{minpval}:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{gene_assoc}: Complete list of gene loci overlapping the region,
      comma-separated
    \item \code{group}: Complete list of gene annotations (e.g. TSS1500, 5'UTR
      etc.) overlapping the region, comma-separated
    \item \code{hg19coords}: Coordinates of the significant region in
      hg19. IGV-friendly.
    \item \code{no.probes}: Number of probes constituting the significant
      region. Tie-breaker when sorting probes by \code{minpval}. A few
      regions may report \code{no.probes=1}, which may seem
      counter-intuitive, but this is only because the adjacent probes are either
      just below the significance threshold, or it is a highly DM probe in a sparse region. Unless \code{pcutoff} is highly conservative, it is unlikely that these regions will report at the head of the sorted list.
    \item \code{minpval}: Minimum adjusted \emph{p}-value from the probes constituting the
      significant region.
    \item \code{meanpval}: Mean adjusted \emph{p}-value from the probes constituting the
      significant region.
    \item \code{maxbetafc}: Maximum absolute beta fold change within the region
  }
  \code{cutoff} is the signficance \emph{p}-value cutoff provided in the call to \code{dmrcate}.
